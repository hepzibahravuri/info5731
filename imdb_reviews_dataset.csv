"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.",7.0,Paragon240,12 July 2023,man wish love movi dont get wrong solid action movi jawdrop stunt best seri mission imposs movi felt like small step backward franchis fallout mindblow action sequenc stunt work along develop ethan relationship ilsa provid closur julia show length ethan would go protect closest battl impos villain dead reckon part one stretch movi across two film seemingli showcas action spectacl action spectacl sacrif charact develop charact grown love decad film felt sidelin ignor wast hayley atwel new charact chew screen time fantast want see origin team new villain inconsist abil confus intimid import emot moment didnt feel weight definit part two might tie everyth togeth make enjoy part one retrospect unfortun left want one
"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.",5.0,ragingbull_2005,18 July 2023,first minut promis intellectu action thriller film start nosed mediocr introduc thief constantli indulg disloyalti petti gain toward imf hunt held high regard hunt life couldnt understand film also doesnt bother itneith concern call action set piec _fallout_ plethora one tie togeth cogent stori line hype run time close minut test patienceread critic review post view make feel written entiti ai behemoth center perceiv entertain valu impli even remot connect realityit wonder falter u box offic top gun maverick crowd go turn especi outsid u cruis star power dont believ plea themdisappoint
"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me. THAT has never happened to me before watching a MI movie!Despite this disappointing conclusion I still wanna thank you for reading my 2001 th review on Imdb.",5.0,imseeg,12 July 2023,consider high expect want avoid sever disappoint new actor lack charismai need viciou bad guy realli pull thrill movii none isnt even one bad guy particular numer supposedli bad guy girl fail impress mehaley atwel cup tea either unfortun get lot screentim last longther way much superflu explanatori talk realli slow movi last way long hour minut half hour could easili cut iti start look watch halfway throughand got bore said say got blip bore that last thing want experi action movi stunt dont look realther heavi layer ad cgi effect real stunt actual stop look real real stunt look way impress behind scene footag actual movi joke fall flatsimon pegg look like realli old man somehow lost usual wit charm delight earlier mi movi without witti simon pegg gone joke well didnt laugh loud smirk timesthi mi movi definit one worst edit worst bore heck never happen watch mi moviedespit disappoint conclus still wan na thank read th review imdb
"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan.

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond?

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture.

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy.

"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me. THAT has never happened to me before watching a MI movie!Despite this disappointing conclusion I still wanna thank you for reading my 2001 th review on Imdb.",5.0,imseeg,12 July 2023,consider high expect want avoid sever disappoint new actor lack charismai need viciou bad guy realli pull thrill movii none isnt even one bad guy particular numer supposedli bad guy girl fail impress mehaley atwel cup tea either unfortun get lot screentim last longther way much superflu explanatori talk realli slow movi last way long hour minut half hour could easili cut iti start look watch halfway throughand got bore said say got blip bore that last thing want experi action movi stunt dont look realther heavi layer ad cgi effect real stunt actual stop look real real stunt look way impress behind scene footag actual movi joke fall flatsimon pegg look like realli old man somehow lost usual wit charm delight earlier mi movi without witti simon pegg gone joke well didnt laugh loud smirk timesthi mi movi definit one worst edit worst bore heck never happen watch mi moviedespit disappoint conclus still wan na thank read th review imdb
"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy.

"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.",6.0,zeki-4,20 July 2023,rememb classic mi scene broke cia cruis hang ceil use wire huge setpiec scene nailbit exampl ingeni problem solvingin dead reckon there none key chang hand everi minut suppos pas suspens cours true sell point stunt perform tom cruisebut want expect thata larg part film devot peopl sit stand room explain plot endless talk explain told sever scene inform heard worst one benji mere repeat thing someon cast make sure everyon audienc know go sloppi write one biggest nono screenwrit resolv say info share benji time incompet usual suppos part small uniqu team save world reallyi hope mi isnt anoth tom cruis stunt reel look like make stori go along long mark check end run face swap deal height etc charact develop take backseat bigger alway better action alway serv stori way around
"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan.

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else.

"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.",6.0,zeki-4,20 July 2023,rememb classic mi scene broke cia cruis hang ceil use wire huge setpiec scene nailbit exampl ingeni problem solvingin dead reckon there none key chang hand everi minut suppos pas suspens cours true sell point stunt perform tom cruisebut want expect thata larg part film devot peopl sit stand room explain plot endless talk explain told sever scene inform heard worst one benji mere repeat thing someon cast make sure everyon audienc know go sloppi write one biggest nono screenwrit resolv say info share benji time incompet usual suppos part small uniqu team save world reallyi hope mi isnt anoth tom cruis stunt reel look like make stori go along long mark check end run face swap deal height etc charact develop take backseat bigger alway better action alway serv stori way around
"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size.

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.",6.0,zeki-4,20 July 2023,rememb classic mi scene broke cia cruis hang ceil use wire huge setpiec scene nailbit exampl ingeni problem solvingin dead reckon there none key chang hand everi minut suppos pas suspens cours true sell point stunt perform tom cruisebut want expect thata larg part film devot peopl sit stand room explain plot endless talk explain told sever scene inform heard worst one benji mere repeat thing someon cast make sure everyon audienc know go sloppi write one biggest nono screenwrit resolv say info share benji time incompet usual suppos part small uniqu team save world reallyi hope mi isnt anoth tom cruis stunt reel look like make stori go along long mark check end run face swap deal height etc charact develop take backseat bigger alway better action alway serv stori way around
"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?!

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on. Nobody else is remotely close to their level. I would gladly watch this again immediately.

"I wanted to write a larhe review, making many details, but then I thought - why? Does this awful movie deserve it? Nope.Let me be short, to fulfil the amount of words and to say the main gist of what I want:
1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ...

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond?

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun).

"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"I wanted to write a larhe review, making many details, but then I thought - why? Does this awful movie deserve it? Nope.Let me be short, to fulfil the amount of words and to say the main gist of what I want:
1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.",6.0,Truedutch,9 July 2023,straight dead reckon part fine think weakest last four instalmentsi cant put finger one exact thing felt littl underdon compar last mi expect big thing whole movi combin thing like act felt littl weak guess script fine action decent great compar mi like john wick im use plot noth new alway still interest especi time real world advanc seem heat whole pickpocket key hour also got bore fast mani clich start pile hand hand combat weakest stuff ive seen especi venic bridg scene look aw like could see choreographi best scene desert storm start realli attent everyth seem averagei dont know everyon el complet trick someon go someon el mask bore stage im kinda roll eye realli hope machin blow fuse mean seen last themtom cruis awesom stunt alway respect thing realli wish didnt show motorbik cliff jump scene trailer see trailer liter whole stunt dont get wrong truli impress show whole thing complet kill meim slightli bum one come see indian jone lot fun watch dont care runtim suck whole time felt timepeopl love movi mi may fizzl bit one
"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"I wanted to write a larhe review, making many details, but then I thought - why? Does this awful movie deserve it? Nope.Let me be short, to fulfil the amount of words and to say the main gist of what I want:
1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me.

Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"I wanted to write a larhe review, making many details, but then I thought - why? Does this awful movie deserve it? Nope.Let me be short, to fulfil the amount of words and to say the main gist of what I want:
1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7. No sense - so, this part is just a huge waste of time.Tom Cruise must stop this for ever. Pity this part makes the whole franchise sour and spoiled. I am very dissapointed.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond?

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train.

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"I wanted to write a larhe review, making many details, but then I thought - why? Does this awful movie deserve it? Nope.Let me be short, to fulfil the amount of words and to say the main gist of what I want:
1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture.

He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was.

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond?

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture.

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan.

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged.

"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture.

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise.

"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan.

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else.

"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.",7.0,Paragon240,12 July 2023,man wish love movi dont get wrong solid action movi jawdrop stunt best seri mission imposs movi felt like small step backward franchis fallout mindblow action sequenc stunt work along develop ethan relationship ilsa provid closur julia show length ethan would go protect closest battl impos villain dead reckon part one stretch movi across two film seemingli showcas action spectacl action spectacl sacrif charact develop charact grown love decad film felt sidelin ignor wast hayley atwel new charact chew screen time fantast want see origin team new villain inconsist abil confus intimid import emot moment didnt feel weight definit part two might tie everyth togeth make enjoy part one retrospect unfortun left want one
"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond?

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture.

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan.

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond?

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture.

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy.

"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me. THAT has never happened to me before watching a MI movie!Despite this disappointing conclusion I still wanna thank you for reading my 2001 th review on Imdb.",5.0,imseeg,12 July 2023,consider high expect want avoid sever disappoint new actor lack charismai need viciou bad guy realli pull thrill movii none isnt even one bad guy particular numer supposedli bad guy girl fail impress mehaley atwel cup tea either unfortun get lot screentim last longther way much superflu explanatori talk realli slow movi last way long hour minut half hour could easili cut iti start look watch halfway throughand got bore said say got blip bore that last thing want experi action movi stunt dont look realther heavi layer ad cgi effect real stunt actual stop look real real stunt look way impress behind scene footag actual movi joke fall flatsimon pegg look like realli old man somehow lost usual wit charm delight earlier mi movi without witti simon pegg gone joke well didnt laugh loud smirk timesthi mi movi definit one worst edit worst bore heck never happen watch mi moviedespit disappoint conclus still wan na thank read th review imdb
"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy.

"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.",6.0,zeki-4,20 July 2023,rememb classic mi scene broke cia cruis hang ceil use wire huge setpiec scene nailbit exampl ingeni problem solvingin dead reckon there none key chang hand everi minut suppos pas suspens cours true sell point stunt perform tom cruisebut want expect thata larg part film devot peopl sit stand room explain plot endless talk explain told sever scene inform heard worst one benji mere repeat thing someon cast make sure everyon audienc know go sloppi write one biggest nono screenwrit resolv say info share benji time incompet usual suppos part small uniqu team save world reallyi hope mi isnt anoth tom cruis stunt reel look like make stori go along long mark check end run face swap deal height etc charact develop take backseat bigger alway better action alway serv stori way around
"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan.

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else.

"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.",6.0,zeki-4,20 July 2023,rememb classic mi scene broke cia cruis hang ceil use wire huge setpiec scene nailbit exampl ingeni problem solvingin dead reckon there none key chang hand everi minut suppos pas suspens cours true sell point stunt perform tom cruisebut want expect thata larg part film devot peopl sit stand room explain plot endless talk explain told sever scene inform heard worst one benji mere repeat thing someon cast make sure everyon audienc know go sloppi write one biggest nono screenwrit resolv say info share benji time incompet usual suppos part small uniqu team save world reallyi hope mi isnt anoth tom cruis stunt reel look like make stori go along long mark check end run face swap deal height etc charact develop take backseat bigger alway better action alway serv stori way around
"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size.

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.",6.0,zeki-4,20 July 2023,rememb classic mi scene broke cia cruis hang ceil use wire huge setpiec scene nailbit exampl ingeni problem solvingin dead reckon there none key chang hand everi minut suppos pas suspens cours true sell point stunt perform tom cruisebut want expect thata larg part film devot peopl sit stand room explain plot endless talk explain told sever scene inform heard worst one benji mere repeat thing someon cast make sure everyon audienc know go sloppi write one biggest nono screenwrit resolv say info share benji time incompet usual suppos part small uniqu team save world reallyi hope mi isnt anoth tom cruis stunt reel look like make stori go along long mark check end run face swap deal height etc charact develop take backseat bigger alway better action alway serv stori way around
"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?!

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U.

"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on. Nobody else is remotely close to their level. I would gladly watch this again immediately.

"I wanted to write a larhe review, making many details, but then I thought - why? Does this awful movie deserve it? Nope.Let me be short, to fulfil the amount of words and to say the main gist of what I want:
1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ...

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond?

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun).

"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"I wanted to write a larhe review, making many details, but then I thought - why? Does this awful movie deserve it? Nope.Let me be short, to fulfil the amount of words and to say the main gist of what I want:
1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.",6.0,Truedutch,9 July 2023,straight dead reckon part fine think weakest last four instalmentsi cant put finger one exact thing felt littl underdon compar last mi expect big thing whole movi combin thing like act felt littl weak guess script fine action decent great compar mi like john wick im use plot noth new alway still interest especi time real world advanc seem heat whole pickpocket key hour also got bore fast mani clich start pile hand hand combat weakest stuff ive seen especi venic bridg scene look aw like could see choreographi best scene desert storm start realli attent everyth seem averagei dont know everyon el complet trick someon go someon el mask bore stage im kinda roll eye realli hope machin blow fuse mean seen last themtom cruis awesom stunt alway respect thing realli wish didnt show motorbik cliff jump scene trailer see trailer liter whole stunt dont get wrong truli impress show whole thing complet kill meim slightli bum one come see indian jone lot fun watch dont care runtim suck whole time felt timepeopl love movi mi may fizzl bit one
"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"I wanted to write a larhe review, making many details, but then I thought - why? Does this awful movie deserve it? Nope.Let me be short, to fulfil the amount of words and to say the main gist of what I want:
1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me.

Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"I wanted to write a larhe review, making many details, but then I thought - why? Does this awful movie deserve it? Nope.Let me be short, to fulfil the amount of words and to say the main gist of what I want:
1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7. No sense - so, this part is just a huge waste of time.Tom Cruise must stop this for ever. Pity this part makes the whole franchise sour and spoiled. I am very dissapointed.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond?

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train.

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"I wanted to write a larhe review, making many details, but then I thought - why? Does this awful movie deserve it? Nope.Let me be short, to fulfil the amount of words and to say the main gist of what I want:
1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture.

He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was.

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond?

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture.

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan.

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged.

"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture.

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise.

"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan.

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else.

"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.",7.0,Paragon240,12 July 2023,man wish love movi dont get wrong solid action movi jawdrop stunt best seri mission imposs movi felt like small step backward franchis fallout mindblow action sequenc stunt work along develop ethan relationship ilsa provid closur julia show length ethan would go protect closest battl impos villain dead reckon part one stretch movi across two film seemingli showcas action spectacl action spectacl sacrif charact develop charact grown love decad film felt sidelin ignor wast hayley atwel new charact chew screen time fantast want see origin team new villain inconsist abil confus intimid import emot moment didnt feel weight definit part two might tie everyth togeth make enjoy part one retrospect unfortun left want one
"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond?

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture.

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan.

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*
""So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!""Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond?

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture.

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy.

"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me. THAT has never happened to me before watching a MI movie!Despite this disappointing conclusion I still wanna thank you for reading my 2001 th review on Imdb.",5.0,imseeg,12 July 2023,consider high expect want avoid sever disappoint new actor lack charismai need viciou bad guy realli pull thrill movii none isnt even one bad guy particular numer supposedli bad guy girl fail impress mehaley atwel cup tea either unfortun get lot screentim last longther way much superflu explanatori talk realli slow movi last way long hour minut half hour could easili cut iti start look watch halfway throughand got bore said say got blip bore that last thing want experi action movi stunt dont look realther heavi layer ad cgi effect real stunt actual stop look real real stunt look way impress behind scene footag actual movi joke fall flatsimon pegg look like realli old man somehow lost usual wit charm delight earlier mi movi without witti simon pegg gone joke well didnt laugh loud smirk timesthi mi movi definit one worst edit worst bore heck never happen watch mi moviedespit disappoint conclus still wan na thank read th review imdb
"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy.

"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.",6.0,zeki-4,20 July 2023,rememb classic mi scene broke cia cruis hang ceil use wire huge setpiec scene nailbit exampl ingeni problem solvingin dead reckon there none key chang hand everi minut suppos pas suspens cours true sell point stunt perform tom cruisebut want expect thata larg part film devot peopl sit stand room explain plot endless talk explain told sever scene inform heard worst one benji mere repeat thing someon cast make sure everyon audienc know go sloppi write one biggest nono screenwrit resolv say info share benji time incompet usual suppos part small uniqu team save world reallyi hope mi isnt anoth tom cruis stunt reel look like make stori go along long mark check end run face swap deal height etc charact develop take backseat bigger alway better action alway serv stori way around
"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat.

"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.",,RennerFilms,8 July 2023,new mi film event part onward theyv spectacular sthere good stuff sure overal solid simpli good previou entriesi kept notic lot scene peopl kept imagin crew mask well cast camera wasnt cant easi make huge movi like pandem definit showsth plot quit good hunt asyetunknown backstori quit intrigu whole stori basic revolv around ive got key she got key he got key etc much pickpocketingalso realli wish hadnt ruin motorcycl jump promo youv seen promo youv seen scene realli action sequenc noth havent realli seen actual enjoy first desert shootout bestand oh exposit there scene near begin remind neil breen movi power peopl sit room spout buzz word like nuclear war econom collaps dog cat live togeth etcthat said still tom alway give best rest cast good especi four femal lead thought ad humour hunt charact nice touch id rather watch ten time blatant cyncial disney cashgrab
"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan.

"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else.

"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size. Why would that be a thing? A bored programmer with an interest in typography?Preventing the film from being a total disaster are a great turn by Pom Klementieff as blonde henchwoman Paris, the actress stealing every scene she is in despite having next to no dialogue, and an incredible finale in which Ethan and Grace must race through several of the train's carriages that are dangling over the edge of a bridge, director Christopher McQuarrie reminding us a little too late that he can put together an effective action scene.",5.0,BA_Harrison,11 July 2023,mission imposs one rare franchis get better better instal nowth plot sum word ethan hunt must find special key save human ai entiti yet writer make matter unnecessarili convolut film wind incred hour minut long larg percentag far whiteknuckl action lead seriou pace issueson film key setpiec car chase ethan newest imf member grace hayley atwel careen yellow fiat play laugh odd gener tone franchis roger moor abl make kind nonsens work eye silli yellow car cv dead reckon embarrassingth deactiv bomb benji simon pegg pointless piec pad must solv sever wellknown riddl order second spare end final piec puzzl could easili solv simpli rotat last dial remain option doesnt occur brainiac benji entir scene could cut film without detrimentcruis muchtout motorcycl jump cliff see ethan ride bike high speed rough rocki terrain toward precipic im expert wouldnt hit extrem uneven ground speed caus crash realiti cruis pelt along special construct smooth ramp rocki ground ad digit postin one ridicul scene hunt rescu grace parachut side move train carriag built balsa wood right gun tote henchman chanc equal unlik bad guy gabriel esai moral depart speed locomot fall backward train onto crash mat wait truck feat realist would le chanc success ask hayley atwel dateand graphic design hate fact grace variou crime flash laptop screen misdemeanour differ font point size would thing bore programm interest typographyprev film total disast great turn pom klementieff blond henchwoman pari actress steal everi scene despit next dialogu incred final ethan grace must race sever train carriag dangl edg bridg director christoph mcquarri remind u littl late put togeth effect action scene

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.",6.0,zeki-4,20 July 2023,rememb classic mi scene broke cia cruis hang ceil use wire huge setpiec scene nailbit exampl ingeni problem solvingin dead reckon there none key chang hand everi minut suppos pas suspens cours true sell point stunt perform tom cruisebut want expect thata larg part film devot peopl sit stand room explain plot endless talk explain told sever scene inform heard worst one benji mere repeat thing someon cast make sure everyon audienc know go sloppi write one biggest nono screenwrit resolv say info share benji time incompet usual suppos part small uniqu team save world reallyi hope mi isnt anoth tom cruis stunt reel look like make stori go along long mark check end run face swap deal height etc charact develop take backseat bigger alway better action alway serv stori way around
"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless.

"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on.

1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that.

"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
"Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

"Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series.

"After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick.

"4 considerations for those with high expectations and who want to avoid severe disappointment:1 THE NEW ACTORS LACK CHARISMAI NEED a vicious bad guy, to really pull me into the thrill of the moviie, but none of that! There isnt even one bad guy in particular, because there are now numerous supposedly ""bad"" guys / girls and they all FAIL to impress me.Haley Atwell is not my cup of tea either. She unfortunately does get a lot of screentime.2 IT LASTS TOO LONGThere is WAY too much superfluous (explanatory) talk that really slows down this movie. It lasts WAY too long because of it ( 2hours and 43 minutes). Half an hour could have been easily cut out of it!I started looking at my watch, halfway through...and I got BORED. There I said it. I say it again, I got blipping bored. That's the last thing I want to experience during an action movie!3 THE STUNTS DONT LOOK REALThere is such a heavy layer of ADDED CGI effects, that the REAL stunts actually stop looking real at all. The real stunts look WAY more impressive in the behind the scenes footage, than they do in the actual movie.4 THE JOKES FALL FLATSimon Pegg looks like a really old man now and he somehow has lost his usual wit and charm, which were a delight in the earlier MI movies. Without a witty Simon Pegg, GONE are the jokes as well. I didnt laugh out loud once. I smirked a few times...This MI movie is definitely one of the worst editions, if not the very worst, because it BORED the heck out of me.

"Mission Impossible is one of those rare franchises that has been getting better and better with each installment. Until now.The plot can be summed up in a few words -- Ethan Hunt must find a special key to save humanity from an AI entity -- and yet the writers make matters so unnecessarily convoluted that the film winds up at an incredible 2 hours and 43 minutes long, a large percentage of which is far from white-knuckle action. This leads to some serious pacing issues.One of the film's key set-pieces -- a car chase in which Ethan and the newest IMF member Grace (Hayley Atwell) careen about in a yellow Fiat 500 -- is played for laughs, which is at odds with the general tone of the franchise. Roger Moore was just about able to make this kind of nonsense work in For Your Eyes Only (his silly yellow car being a 2CV), but in Dead Reckoning, it's just embarrassing.The deactivation of a bomb by Benji (Simon Pegg) is a pointless piece of padding: he must solve several well-known riddles in order to do so, with seconds to spare at the end. The final piece of the puzzle could easily be solved by simply rotating the last dial through all the remaining options, but that doesn't occur to brainiac Benji. This entire scene could have been cut from the film without detriment.Cruise's much-touted motorcycle jump off a cliff sees Ethan riding his bike at high speed over rough, rocky terrain towards the precipice. I'm no expert, but wouldn't hitting extremely uneven ground at that speed cause him to crash? (in reality, Cruise pelted along a specially constructed, very smooth ramp, the rocky ground added digitally in post).In one of the most ridiculous scenes, Hunt rescues Grace by parachuting through the side of a moving train (this carriage built from balsa wood?), right into a gun toting henchman -- what are the chances?. Equally unlikely is how bad guy Gabriel (Esai Morales) departs from the speeding locomotive: by falling backwards off the train onto a crash mat in a waiting truck, a feat that, realistically, would have less chance of success than me asking Hayley Atwell for a date.And as a graphic designer, I hated the fact that when Grace's various crimes flash up on a laptop screen, each misdemeanour is in a different font and point size.

"Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in ""Sicario"" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are ""so cheesy."")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.",4.0,210west,18 July 2023,basic movi big loud stupiddefinit loud fact music attempt turn even minor scene sort heartpound climaxther endless ridicul fight tom cruis predict unstopp matter mani oppon he slim girl get beat multipl men emili blunt right comment fight sicario refreshingli lose bigger guy note hollywood fight scene pound woman whip larger male cheesyth dull tepid waytoopretti villain implaus formid fighter sure doesnt look like one action movi good villain evil guy look like french fashion mogulh cruis fight top wait move train havent seen ridicul sort thing hundr time beforeth tedious overcompl plot make hard keep track who side care appar usual day suppos root u governmentin scene involv convers virtual everi line mere plot exposit charact tell u stilt dialogu what go what suppos happen suppos feelth muchtout parachut jump actual disappoint quit fast main sourc interest youv seen promot video know cruis actual made jumpth truli enjoy sequenc cleverli workedout rescu attempt fall train come end nearli two half hour empti cartoonish nonsenseinclud cours overlong cartoonish car chase obligatori dumb summer movi
"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.",10.0,masonsaul,10 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part one confirm mission imposs best franchis current go possibl ever made hour minut adrenalin rush contain best action sequenc put film embarrass major competit set stage magnific part whilst still satisfi adventur rightthi possibl open obviou mission film deeper mean cinema aspect cruis career dissect time film focus ethan relationship woman basic outright declar ai soulless monster human element alway need perfect film releas writer striketom cruis perfect ethan hunt strongest aspect time round film explor made ethan remind genuin care team come cost physic madman still go strong stunt drive bike cliff truli breathtak fashionv rhame simon pegg rebecca ferguson remain best imf team play strength longer seri goe authent grow friendship feel shea whigham greg tarzan davi get expect buddi cop antic lot funwith esai moral charismat yet terrifi gabriel pom klementieff terrif henchman word franchis final good villain bad return henri czerni kittridg gloriou remain gleefulli despic first appearanceth best new addit easili hayley atwel play type charact never seen film make charact dynam cruis fresh comparison everyon who come chemistri magnet instantan second interactchristoph mcquarri direct phenomen action sequenc suitabl practic spend million camera get close action humanli possibl remain one best busi work scale there plenti cant angl nice homag de palma origin help give one style comparison mcquarri previou entriesth pace realli impress film feel like perpetu third act first airport heist much fun lorn balf music yet highlight film know elev everyth well realli hammer home emot beat
"Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating.

"The cold opening is tense, gripping in some ways and interesting in others. After the credits roll, Tom Cruise is still top-notch as Ethan Hunt and that signature run still excites. Something's off with his core team. They're barely on screen, especially Ving Rhames' Luther who disappears in the final act. The landscape is beautiful and the movie utilizes the elements in its action scenes, mainly in the desert scenes. The premise of a sentient digital world-controlling ""entity"" is intriguing. We're off to good start and then we meet Grace. I like Hayley Atwell. I don't like Hayley Atwell as Grace. Grace, the pretty pickpocket, is the key to everything. Ethan saves her, she betrays him, and leaves him for dead (or capture) and this cycle repeats throughout the movie, making the plot predictable and boring, and their chase scenes felt like a bad romantic and slapstick comedy. No matter how much Ethan saves her life or risks his for hers, she's never loyal to him. Nothing binds her to him. Yet, before Ethan does a death-defying stunt off a mountain to land on a train, he reflects on the great loves he lost or could lose and he sees IIsa's (Rebecca Ferguson) face and a love he lost early in his IMF career...and Grace. Grace? Why?! She's a great love of his life?? Again, why? Grace also caused IIsa's death, which is glossed over and passed off as IIsa sacrificing her life for Grace. I found that disingenuous as a fan. I love Rebecca Ferguson's IIsa character and she fit within the MI franchise. Grace is forced and forgettable. I think MI wanted Grace to be some mysterious, intriguing, unforgettable beauty like Halle Berry' Jinx or an Irene Adler and Hayley Atwell could not stick the landing. She did nail Tom Cruise. They were dating during filming. I guess it pays to date The Boss. Others things that failed Dead Reckoning for me was the villain Gabriel and his henchman Paris. Both were too generic to be memorable or any significant impact. The final never-ending train derailment almost made me exit the theater. MI 2 was my least favorite in the franchise until now.

"Reading good reviews of this feels like I'm being gaslit. Stemming from the script, which should be taught in a classroom of how not to write, everything simply did not work. It is so bad I laughed out loud so many times when it was trying to be serious but was incredibly stilted. The actors don't look like they even believe the lines that are put in their mouths. Nor should they. Compared to the previous movies, this doesn't even feel like a MI franchise film. The nonsense that constantly ramps up the stakes. The 90s BS of how crap the women are written. The ways that the acting are undermined by spelling out something the audience already knows. Whoever wrote this should never work again. And whoever greenlit it should similarly be shunted for someone with better projects than this in mind.This could very well be the end of the franchise. I know from an hour and a half in I was wanting to check my phone to see how much longer it was going to be. They would have to pay me to watch the sequel. Nothing interesting about the plot arc came to fruition. If there weren't some descent action sequences and its looks, this would be a 1 star film. How this gets positive ratings I'll never know. Especially from people, presumably, who have consumed previous instalments that are demonstrably better in every single respect.

"This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!?

"There are no major spoilers but some minor plot exposition in this review.The Mission Impossible franchise was essentially rebooted when J. J. Abrams stepped in to make M:I:3. He saw the critical flaw from the first film when the likeable M:I team was killed off in the first act. Now, no more double-crossing within the crew. He also added a slight tone of humour, demonstrating a sense of fun for the audience. Abrams went on to make similar improvements to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises. Since then M:I has taken off. Now, the new focus is less about the villain than it is about amping up the action. Mission Impossible is a product of the original James Bond era of the 1960s. Many TV shows were developed to cash in on the slick spy genre. So it is not a surprise that this franchise has essentially become the American equivalent of the British Bond franchise.However, it is hard these days to come up with original action set pieces. How many times have we seen fight scenes staged on top of trains? (including Indiana Jones 5, released right before this film). Or a chase scene in a comically tiny car (also found in Indy 5). There is a gag where Cruise and his new female cohort are handcuffed while driving in a car chase. This was done in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" with Pierce Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh on a motorcycle. They drive down a large number of stairs, something seen previously in other chase scenes. There is a scene where Hayley Atwell surreptitiously steals a paper clip to escape from her shackles. This was famously done by Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2. I'm not sure but Cruise himself might have previously done the paper clip gag as well. Brosnan first did the skydive off a cliff on a motorcycle in ""Goldeneye"".Another gag that gets old is the face mask. How does a mask change the shape and size of your body? Of the square or roundness of the face? In this movie, one character puts on a face mask in mere seconds. But what about touchups needed around the eyes and mouth to make the skin look seamless?Then (here it comes) there is the long running time. This is due in part because the film literally has about 5 groups of people chasing one another. There is the M:I group chasing after the Maguffin. There is the CIA group chasing after Cruise. There is the Paris (a woman not the city) gang, also chasing after Cruise chasing after the Maguffin. Also following the followers is a character called the White widow. Then there is Atwell, who sometimes goes rogue. Then there is Rebecca Ferguson, since she made such a great improvement to the cast. They even resurrect Henry Czerny as Kittridge, who also is in on the chase. Why so many characters? Why deliberately stretch the running time to almost 3 hours? Do they really think that's what audiences want? Believe it or not, there is such a thing as an action scene being too long. The cat and mouse play between action scenes starts to get tedious as well. What really stretches the running time is all these characters explaining whats going on to other characters. And it is literally ""Character A has to meet Character B at such and such a place at a certain time"". Things get convoluted to the point that you start losing interest in characters' motivations.Ultimately, it is hard to dislike Cruise. I will recommend this film because it delivers the goods, but loses major points for thinking people want to sit and watch 3 hours of action scenes, even if they are well done. 6 out of 10.",6.0,kgprophet,15 July 2023,major spoiler minor plot exposit reviewth mission imposs franchis essenti reboot j j abram step make mi saw critic flaw first film likeabl mi team kill first act doublecross within crew also ad slight tone humour demonstr sen fun audienc abram went make similar improv star trek star war franchis sinc mi taken new focu le villain amp action mission imposs product origin jame bond era mani tv show develop cash slick spi genr surpris franchis essenti becom american equival british bond franchisehowev hard day come origin action set piec mani time seen fight scene stage top train includ indiana jone releas right film chase scene comic tini car also found indi gag cruis new femal cohort handcuf drive car chase done tomorrow never die pierc brosnan michel yeoh motorcycl drive larg number stair someth seen previous chase scene scene hayley atwel surreptiti steal paper clip escap shackl famous done linda hamilton termin im sure cruis might previous done paper clip gag well brosnan first skydiv cliff motorcycl goldeneyeanoth gag get old face mask mask chang shape size bodi squar round face movi one charact put face mask mere second touchup need around eye mouth make skin look seamlessthen come long run time due part film liter group peopl chase one anoth mi group chase maguffin cia group chase cruis pari woman citi gang also chase cruis chase maguffin also follow follow charact call white widow atwel sometim goe rogu rebecca ferguson sinc made great improv cast even resurrect henri czerni kittridg also chase mani charact deliber stretch run time almost hour realli think that audienc want believ thing action scene long cat mous play action scene start get tediou well realli stretch run time charact explain what go charact liter charact meet charact b place certain time thing get convolut point start lose interest charact motivationsultim hard dislik cruis recommend film deliv good lose major point think peopl want sit watch hour action scene even well done
"I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing ""the key."" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.",6.0,robchat,8 July 2023,lucki abl watch day offici releas czech republ prepremier didnt know thing exist first time ive felt real excit go watch film cinema age thank recent geniu combin fallout top gun know tri film bring kittridg back convolut train final hark back st movi spark explain convolut storylin along way hark back critic made first filmth sky jump stunt attempt beat stunt tom cruis previou instal becom belov trademark franchisebut film unfortun overal reminisc second instal tom cruis centric lack real imposs mission requir teamwork real stake ingeni problem solvingin fact could even intent film remind viewer mission imposs photo film past ethan hunt search present ethan hunt show longer hair look second filmultim expect stori way better get instalmentther guy keep appear scene tri catch ethan seem cheap simpl storyand simpl plot explain long scene make seem way complic actual peopl complain explan first film least plot first film actual requir brain power say act quit poor time help rather cheesi line script includ line accent open russian submarin sequencether also much action main action sequenc close hour movi desert shoot begin venic car chase train crash endi thought alleyway fight scene prais realli quit subpar enthrallingth best action scene venic car chase genuin funni ye excel laugh loud funni way ten never feel edg seatth motorcycl sky jump scene major disappoint hype didnt know cruis actual stunt use much cgi peopl would assum comput gener actual remind pierc brosnan ride tsunami die anoth day sorri tom stunt still awesometh train end know actual made train probabl actual threw bridg doesnt look real though long action final fun watch lack realism take away tension enjoy visual valu feel wow factor tensionat end fallout exampl realli felt ethan hunt batter bruis worn still fight save human none thatth tragic thing movi unlik best previou film back team irrelev one benji luther dont actual muchand poor ilsa fallout end ethan exwif essenti give permiss move ilsath relationship ilsa hunt built two excel movi rogu nation fallout film say almost noth look grumpi sad time die anticlimact fight liter spelt audienc way replac newcom gracegrac play hayley atwel good likeabl charact capabl actress dont get stori unless rebecca ferguson said want franchiseth film chase key twist high stake virtual gritti outing feel lightultim hope enjoy qualiti film franchis movi like oblivion edg tomorrow fallout top gun american made show anyon say recent realli high qualiti film star guy call tom cruisethi one filmsit like mummi better mission imposs better other franchis
"Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to ""so what you are saying is, that..."" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.",6.0,zeki-4,20 July 2023,rememb classic mi scene broke cia cruis hang ceil use wire huge setpiec scene nailbit exampl ingeni problem solvingin dead reckon there none key chang hand everi minut suppos pas suspens cours true sell point stunt perform tom cruisebut want expect thata larg part film devot peopl sit stand room explain plot endless talk explain told sever scene inform heard worst one benji mere repeat thing someon cast make sure everyon audienc know go sloppi write one biggest nono screenwrit resolv say info share benji time incompet usual suppos part small uniqu team save world reallyi hope mi isnt anoth tom cruis stunt reel look like make stori go along long mark check end run face swap deal height etc charact develop take backseat bigger alway better action alway serv stori way around
"To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: ""I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key"" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like ""nuclear war,"" ""economic collapse,"" ""dogs and cats living together"" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch.

"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be ""bigger"" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is ""Part One"" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (""Band of Brothers""), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.",8.0,ferguson-6,9 July 2023,greet dark challeng continu mission imposs franchis fan expect entri bigger aweinspir last seventh film seri third straight direct writerdirector christoph mcquarri superstar actor daredevil tom cruis manag accomplish seem unlik deliv ethan hunt biggest grandest mission yet prepar awe actiony know part one run minut full hour longer movi exponenti expens produc age ultrahighbudget blockbust rumor fade public interest cours one year remov tom cruis top gun maverick credit save cinema stay alert sky fall panic mcquarri cowrot script erik jendresen band brother remain faith charact storylin establish tv seri creator bruce gellerther may never actor suit recur role tom cruis ethan hunt harrison ford indiana jone might closest stori fairli straightforward even item chase often feel like macguffin question simpl spythril effect understand yet fascin watch ethan hunt mission life agent evalu cost he paid man provid contemporari theme obscur object desir allpow key actual two part key base control allencompass artifici intellig aiin twist familiar theme classic comedi film airport train ev latter tini fiat handcuff still car chase everyth might hope hightech facial search airport sequenc deliv thrill techi viewer train spar occur insid well top lest worri enough cruis sprint scene put chariot fire shamefamiliar face includ ethan hunt team luther ving rhame along cruis appear mi film benji simon pegg ilsa faust rebecca ferguson nice see hear henri czerni kittridg vanessa kirbi arm dealer white widow esai moral gabriel requir villain search key good guy new face includ hayle atwel master pickpocket grace whose soul may may beyond salvat cari elw agenc director denling shea whigham greg tarzan davi offic rogu hunt pom klementieff hire assassinth stunt work outstand cours tom cruis renown person handl mani breathtak act memor one ride motorcycl cliff stunt make video that avail movi goer weve never seen anyth like part one origin schedul releas thank lot covid part two set year sinc mission imposs jon voight cruis one particular mission biggest yet would certainli imposs rest u mission close part two simultan bring end cruis remark run ethan huntopen juli

Did i mention the key. You'll be sick of it after almost three hours. Pegg and rhames are barely in this one. Maybe they'll have more action in part deux. I can't image another two plus hours of this, but hey. They don't pay me 20 million. You've literally seen all this before and if you haven't, they do all of it at least twice.

"No matter what most people say in their reviews this film is not the best one of the franchise.Did we really need another mission film, not really but they are fun to watch though.So as I settled down to watch this film, I came away from watching the movie not over thrilled as I thought I would be.The main bad guy wasn't much of one, being back Harries for the last one at least his bad guy had some balls to him.The alley way fight scene was awfully done, heck I could have filmed a better fight scene than that and Ferguson's sword fight scene was dreadful, it didn't suit this style of movie.Then we had the very weak storyline. Most of the characters in this movie were very one dimensional, which didn't help with the film runtime.The bike jump that has been on the internet for weeks has made the scene when you watch it in the film, as oh I have seen it already and didn't bring as much thrills as it should have.Over all a very disappointing movie to the franchise, will I watch the next one, yes I will as I am a fan of these films.Cruise has recently said he may keep on making them, well if they are going to turn out like this one, don't.",5.0,kjohn-77891,18 July 2023,matter peopl say review film best one franchisedid realli need anoth mission film realli fun watch thoughso settl watch film came away watch movi thrill thought would beth main bad guy wasnt much one back harri last one least bad guy ball himth alley way fight scene aw done heck could film better fight scene ferguson sword fight scene dread didnt suit style moviethen weak storylin charact movi one dimension didnt help film runtimeth bike jump internet week made scene watch film oh seen alreadi didnt bring much thrill haveov disappoint movi franchis watch next one ye fan filmscruis recent said may keep make well go turn like one dont
"Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.",6.0,rashid-popal,11 July 2023,huge fan mi franchis best part mi movi plan pull imposs mission thu quit disappoint mission never seem difficult let alon impossibleact okay car chase funni excit jump cliff seem forc would keep drive uphil take short cut reach train wasnt even fast train key kept stolen pocket mani time make wonder lazi script kill old gf make new gf also lazi writingunlik mi ethan singl smart move plan felt like let go see happensam sure mi fan ignor weak gave film rate
"All of the instalments in this franchise are very wellmade, highly entertaining, decently fun, and always tries to invent more and better stunts. There is also nothing wrong cinematically, and the directing is excellent. This is definitely worth the money, but I still feel like this is lacking, something is missing, there is no soul in this movie.Partly I think it is the acting. Not from Tom, and Harley is amazing as everything she does. But the rest feel like they are just there. Partly it is the ending, which I did not like. There is no cherry on top, no cliffhanger. The movie sort of just ends. Another thing that bothers me is that the chase scene and adrenaline inducing events are there to entertain yes, and oh boy do they deliver, but I also feel like that is their only purpose. This is almost like watching Fast&Furious, only less crazy and better acted.I do highly recommend this movie, and if you liked previous instalment's you will love this one. And the action is insanely good at times. However this movie did not do it for me. Time to end this franchise because clearly the people involved have started to get bored with it, and so have I.7/10 and a good very entertaining movie, but hollow and soulless. If it wasn't for a couple of action scenes I would not remember a single thing about this movie in a couple of days.",7.0,namob-43673,12 July 2023,instal franchis wellmad highli entertain decent fun alway tri invent better stunt also noth wrong cinemat direct excel definit worth money still feel like lack someth miss soul moviepartli think act tom harley amaz everyth rest feel like partli end like cherri top cliffhang movi sort end anoth thing bother chase scene adrenalin induc event entertain ye oh boy deliv also feel like purpos almost like watch fastfuri le crazi better actedi highli recommend movi like previou instal love one action insan good time howev movi time end franchis clearli peopl involv start get bore good entertain movi hollow soulless wasnt coupl action scene would rememb singl thing movi coupl day
"I have just watched the greatest car-chase in the history of cinema.. and that still wasn't even the best scene in the movie!After the fantastic underwater opening, and introduction of what the next Impossible Mission will be - the rest of the film is essentially just 4 HUGE action set-pieces. Like nothing you have ever experienced on screen before.Everything gets exponentially more epic as time passes. You think ""Surely now this has peaked"" .. but NO! Something else will come crashing onto screen, the stakes will rise even higher, and off we go again..The pacing is quite unique - it feels like a sequence of thrilling short-films, while still working as a whole narrative. There is an awesome momentum pulsing through every moment. I can't imagine how they will top this with Part 2 - but I cannot wait to find out!Epic movement, ambition, stunts, humour, brilliant new characters and sheer bravado behind the camera. How did they ever film this practically.. in a pandemic! Obviously you should watch this on the biggest cinema screen possible. The moment where a train enters a tunnel - literally breath-taking.If I were looking for faults.. I would say the 2 exposition scenes drag on a bit - it almost felt like they were repeating themselves. But even then you can't complain because they are so stylishly filmed - more so then ever before in this franchise.Just let Cruise and McQuarrie produce every action film made from now on. Nobody else is remotely close to their level. I would gladly watch this again immediately.

"I wanted to write a larhe review, making many details, but then I thought - why? Does this awful movie deserve it? Nope.Let me be short, to fulfil the amount of words and to say the main gist of what I want:
1. No humor. That is why this movie is so awful.2. Repetitions - we saw it all in previous parts. So, why bother?3. No depth - so, all the characters are one-dimensional and shallow.4. No sympathy to any hero - so, the demise of some of them make us vapid and indifferent.5. No plot - so, the whole idea is just a joke.6. No control - so, this even First part drags on forever.7. No sense - so, this part is just a huge waste of time.Tom Cruise must stop this for ever. Pity this part makes the whole franchise sour and spoiled. I am very dissapointed.

"Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.",6.0,Truedutch,9 July 2023,straight dead reckon part fine think weakest last four instalmentsi cant put finger one exact thing felt littl underdon compar last mi expect big thing whole movi combin thing like act felt littl weak guess script fine action decent great compar mi like john wick im use plot noth new alway still interest especi time real world advanc seem heat whole pickpocket key hour also got bore fast mani clich start pile hand hand combat weakest stuff ive seen especi venic bridg scene look aw like could see choreographi best scene desert storm start realli attent everyth seem averagei dont know everyon el complet trick someon go someon el mask bore stage im kinda roll eye realli hope machin blow fuse mean seen last themtom cruis awesom stunt alway respect thing realli wish didnt show motorbik cliff jump scene trailer see trailer liter whole stunt dont get wrong truli impress show whole thing complet kill meim slightli bum one come see indian jone lot fun watch dont care runtim suck whole time felt timepeopl love movi mi may fizzl bit one
"'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.",8.0,gavinp9,8 July 2023,mission imposs dead reckon part mi anoth strong entri actionspi seri ethan cruis look slightli older le determin save world believ sequel film last outing well see time there skynetlik sentientai that manipul nefari type take world imf team get two halv key stop itisla ferguson benji pegg luther rhame back well cia bos kittridg czerni grace atwel thief newcom bad guy keep thwart gabriel moral ethan past pari klementieff consist mcquarri director two previou film help everyth feel assur work realli solid followup falloutther funni moment sincer one ethan run contractuallyoblig whole final scene train excel mani thing happen there plenti good setpiec throughout includ good car chase howev piecederesist motorbik cliff base jump someth el fact cruis real multipl time crazi inspir
